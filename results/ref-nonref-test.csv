HLA-DRB5,biased,ref allele bias,clear reference bias,
RP13-487P22.1,indeterminate,,,
GSTM1,biased,most likely ref allele bias,2 snps total for which ref non-ref determined one is 0.87 and other is 0.14 but 7 individuals  ,
MEST,unbiased,,,
IL1RL1,indeterminate,indeterminate,"candidate in which 5 snps for which R, NR can be compared, 3 low data,one which points towards ref bias, 10R, 1NR p=0.006, and one which shows 20 individuals with -0.2 ",discrepancy with table saying 1/7 whereas we see only 5 total 
ZNF331,unbiased,,,
hsa-mir-335,unbiased,,,
DIRAS3,indeterminate,,,
MRPS34,indeterminate,,ref bias from 1 informative snp 0.73  22 individuals,discrepancy with table listing all genes which says 1/2 rather than 1/1
PWRN1,biased,,,
HLA-DQB1,biased,ref allele bias,"many snps analyzed, most show ref bias",
PAX8-AS1,biased,ref allele bias,"2 snps with clear bias and 1 with only 2 individuals, so doesn’t contribute",discrepancy only 3 tests instead of 6
HNRNPU,biased,ref allele bias,"2 snps with clear bias and 1 with only 2 individuals, so doesn’t contribute",discrepancy only 6 instead of 9
GFRA2,indeterminate,"indeterminate, could be ref bias, too little data","some individuals amongst the 20 (13/7) are conflict individuals where there is another snp saying biallelic, so n probably closer too 10 with 8R, 2NR",discrepancy with table listing all genes which says 0/3 rather than 0/1 rejected
TMIE,biased,"ref allele bias, 1 snp only assessable",1 snp biased,
RP11-54F2.1,biased,"ref allele bias probably, 1 snp marginal",1 snp with marginal significance,
HLA-DQA1,biased,ref allele bias,clear ref allele bias,discrepancy only 11 instead of 20
SYT7,indeterminate,"indeterminate, could be ref bias, too little data","both low data, but 5/1 6/1 R/NR, so probably biased",discreapncy only 2 instead of 5
NME1-NME2,biased,"ref allele bias, 1 snp only assessable","1 snp, 20NR, 7 R p ~0.01 biased",discrepancy only 1 test instead of 2
RAD23A,indeterminate,,,
RP11-215G15.5,biased,,,
GPR75-ASB3,indeterminate,"indeterminate, could be ref bias, too little data",1 snp showing trend towards ref bias,"discrepancy, 1 instead of3"
