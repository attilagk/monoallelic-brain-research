# Notes on manuscript draft

Title: *Novel monoallelically-expressed genes and relaxation of imprinting with advanced age in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.*

abbrev. | concept
------------- | -------------
(R)MAE | (random) monoallelic expression
SCZ | schizophrenia

## Rationale and expectations

### Functional roles
* in immune and olfactory system clear function: RMAE ensures one cell---one receptor
* hypothetical function of RMAE in brain?
    * MHC association to SCZ => immunity. Mechanism in SCZ?  Autoimmune disease?
    * other roles (beyond immunity)?
* hypothetical function of imprinting?

### Onset and extent of RMAE
* X-inactivation expected to be polyclonal in brain sample
"the unsurprising notion that most samples are polyclonal with respect to X inactivation" (p.5).  Basis of expectation?
* RMAE expected to be monoclonal?  Why?  Developmental onset of RMAE?
* in limphoblastoid cell lines: RMAE is widespread (occurs in 5-10 % of genes, Gimelbrandt et al) consistent with role in immunity
* known extent of RMAE in other cell lines or tissue types?  Does extent correlate with functional imporatnce in some tissue?

### Molecular mechanisms

* expected lenght of epigenetic marks
    * imprinting
    * RMAE

## Methodology

* quantity of interest: **allelic imbalance** (avoid skewness: confusing terminology)
* should we care for error rates? Currently heuristics: "To be conservative about calling monoallelic expression" (p.4)
    * are there gold standard data for MAE?
* invest in statistical modeling of allelic imbalance?
    * length of epigenetic marks: correlation between loci (SNPs)
    * dissect sources of variability: across subjects, cell clones/tissues, technical noise (read depth, quality,...)

## Findings

### Extent of MAE

"the discordance rate (monoallelic RNA genotype in the context of a heterozygous DNA genotype) was 0.71%" (p.3); consistency with 5-10 % (Gimelbrandt et al)?
