# Notes on manuscript draft

Title: *Novel monoallelically-expressed genes and relaxation of imprinting with advanced age in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.*

abbreviation | concept
------------- | -------------
RMAE | random monoallelic expression
SCZ | schizophrenia

## Rationale and expectations

### Functional roles
* in immune and olfactory system clear function: RMAO ensures one cell---one receptor
* hypothetical function of RMAO in brain?
    * MHC association to SCZ => immunity. Mechanism in SCZ?  Autoimmune disease?
    * other roles (beyond immunity)?

### Developmental onset
* X-inactivation expected to be polyclonal in brain sample
* RMAE expected to be monoclonal?  Why?  How early in development does RMAE occur?


## Methodology
