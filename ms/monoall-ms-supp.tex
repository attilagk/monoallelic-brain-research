Distribution and inter-dependence of explanatory variables.  The diagonal graphs of the
plot-matrix show the marginal distribution of six variables (Age,
Institution,...)~while the off-diagonal graphs show pairwise joint
distributions.  For instance, the upper left graph shows that, in the whole
cohort, individuals' Age
ranges between ca.~15 and 105 years and most individuals around 75 years; the
bottom and right neighbor of this graph both show (albeit in different
representation) the joint distribution of Age and Institution, from which can
be seen that individuals from Pittsburg tended to be younger than those from
the two other institutions.

\caption{ Three model structures: two \emph{fixed} (upper left and right) and
a \emph{mixed} (lower middle) effects multiple regression model.  In all three
model structures the read count ratio \(Y_g\)---for several genes
\(g\)---depends somehow on three explanatory variables \(X_j\) like Age or PMI
(Table~\ref{tab:predictors}).  For each gene \(g\) the probabilistic
dependence is mediated by fixed \(\beta_{1g},\beta_{2g},\beta_{3g}\) or random
\(b_{2g},b_{3g}\) regression coefficients.  \emph{fixed II} is a constrained
version of the \emph{fixed I} model structure such that
\(\beta_{jg_1}=\beta_{jg_2}=...\equiv \beta_j\), which means that the effect
of \(X_j\) on \(Y\) does not vary across genes in \emph{fixed II}.  The
\emph{mixed} model differs from \emph{fixed I}  in the way coefficients across
genes vary for a given explanatory variable \(X_j\).  In the \emph{fixed I}
model structure there is no connection among
\(\beta_{jg_1},\beta_{jg_2},...\), which means that the way \(Y_{g}\), the
read count ratio for gene \(g\) depends on variable \(X_j\) is completely
separate from how the read count ratio for any other gene \(g'\)
(i.e.~\(Y_{g'}\)) depends on \(X_j\).  Consequently, the gene-specific
substructures of \emph{fixed I} contain no information on each other.  This
limitation is overcome with the \emph{mixed} model structure because a set of
coefficients across genes---e.g.~the set \(\{b_{2g}\}_g\))---is modeled as a
random sample from a normal distribution with parameters \(\mu_2\) and some
\(\sigma^2_2>0\).  Thus \(\mu_2\) and \(\sigma^2_2\) constitute information on
the effect that is shared across all genes so that genes ``borrow strength
from each other''.  When \(\sigma^2_j=0\) in the \emph{mixed} model then all parameters \(\{b_{jg}\}_g\) for
\(X_j\) are fixed at \(\mu_j\equiv\beta_j\), which is characteristic to the
\emph{fixed II} model structure.  In the \emph{mixed} model structure this is
seen for \(X_1\), which therefore has the same effect on \(Y_g\) for every
gene \(g\).  In this example all explanatory variables are continuous in both
models.  Any categorical explanatory variable (factor) \(X_j\) with \(K\)
levels would lead to \(K - 1\) fixed or random coefficients
\(\beta_{j_1g},...,\beta_{j_{K-1}g}\) or \(b_{j_1g},...,b_{j_{K-1}g}\) for any
gene \(g\), respectively.  Moreover, if the effect of that categorical \(X_j\)
is random then it is possible to have a continuous \(X_{j'}\) with a random
intercept and slope with respect to \(X_j\).  In fact the \emph{mixed} model structure
(lower middle) is equivalent to another one (not shown), where ``Gene'' is a
random factor \(X_\mathrm{Gene}\) with random slope for the effects of \(X_2\)
and \(X_3\).  }

Fitted curves (black lines) and sampling probabilities (magenta-white-cyan

that Age is the
only explanatory variable.  Simple regression is used for this illustration
only.  For inference and all other plots in this figure multiple regression
was performed, where Age is only one of several explanatory variables (Table~\ref{tab:predictors}).
\emph{Upper right (Normality of residuals):} analysis of the normality of the standardized residuals of
fits suggests wnlm.Q is the best fitting model.
\emph{Lower left (Homogeneity of error variance):} Similar conclusion can be made by inspecting how the
standardized deviance residuals depends on the fitted value.  Goodness of fit
is indicated by the lack of such dependence.  Black curve: LOESS data smoother.
\emph{Lower right (Influence of outliers):} Influence of each individual on
the fit quantified by Cook's
distance (\(y\)-axis).  This is plotted against a function of leverage, which
quantifies a subcomponent of influence that is restricted to explanatory
variables (i.e.~individuals with extreme age, PMI,...). In ideal case all data points
are expected to influence the fit to the same degree and thus have short
Cook's distance.

first subset corresponds to odd ranked genes, while the second to even ranked
genes (see odd and columns in Fig.~4, Fig.~5, and
Fig.~\ref{fig:Q-age}).  A few findings are notable.  First, these results are
less significant in general than those obtained from the full data set
(Table~1), which follows from the reduction both in the number
of data points and in the number of genes.  Second, the term
\((\mathrm{Age}\,|\,\mathrm{Gene})\) is significant for odd ranked genes but
not for even ranked genes.  This agrees with the qualitative pattern seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Q-age}, where the genes in the odd columns show a pronounced
variability with respect to age dependence but genes in even columns do not.
The differences between the two subsets are also explained in part by the fact
that there happen to be more missing data for even ranked genes.
