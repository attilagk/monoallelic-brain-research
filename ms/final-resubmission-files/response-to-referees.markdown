# Response to Referees

## Reviewer 1

> The authors have responded to all of my concerns.


## Reviewer 2

> The authors addressed most of my comments reassuringly. Only two points
remain:

> 1. Our view is that the title accurately reflects the data and analyses we present. - Normal Expression Bias of Imprinted Genes in Schizophrenia 
> 
> I'm afraid I have to insist that the title, in particular the word normal is misleading or uninformative at best. Normal for what, compared to what? On top of it, one of the strength of the study, the analyzed tissue, DLPFC is not even mentioned. A suggestion for a clearer title would be No schizophrenia-specific expression bias in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex No need to stick to this, simply please make clearer what is meant by normal expression bias and potentially add DLPFC. 

Authors: We agree that the word "normal" might be misleading in the title.  The suggested title, however, lacks the "imprinted genes", which were the focus of our study.  Therefore, we came up with a new title: "Unperturbed Expression Bias of Imprinted Genes in Schizophrenia".

> 2. Regarding the extension of this line to asking about top 20 or top 100 in addition to top 50: Figure 3 demonstrates that below about rank 25 (lower half) most of the genes are false positives as they tend to have mapping bias and a high fraction of nearly unbiased data points (tan bars). Thus, taking the top 50 genes with respect to the gene score is sufficient and there is no need to go deeper (such as top 100). 
> 
> The authors argue that the 0.9 is a biologically meaningful threshold. But then in the mixed model fitting, the outcome variable is the (transformed) read-count ratio, which for half of the 30 genes (Fig 3) varies very little between individuals? The authors claim that S=0.8 is not very different from S=0.5, but at the same time they try to model log/rank-transformed S for genes for which the vast majority of S is >0.9? Hence they try to model minute differences, such as e.g. S=0.92 vs S=0.97? I do not get the logic. 
> 
> Plus they state that half of the top 50 genes are false positives. Then the question naturally emerges: why not to take only the top 25? On the other hand in the top 25 there would be even less meaningful variation in the log-transformed S (Q) values, so they would reduce power even more. 

Authors: We agree with the reviewer in that the effect size is relatively small.  We inserted the following text as the third-to-last paragraph of the Results section:
"Although some of the random effects described above are statistically significant (Table~1), their size is relatively subtle (Fig.~5).  How effects translate to biological significance is an open question.  Nonetheless, we focussed on genes with very strong allelic bias, in other words monoallelic expression, because that is a hallmark of imprinted genes.  It is conceivable that a subtle change from, say, completely monoallelic to just nearly monoallelic expression corresponds to a qualitative change that carries some biological significance."
