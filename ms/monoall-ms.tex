\section{Main text}

How gene expression correlates with schizophrenia across individuals is
beginning to be examined through analyses of RNA-seq from post-mortem brains
of individuals with disease and control brains~\cite{Fromer2016a}.  Here we
focus on variation in allele-specific expression, following up on the
CommonMind Consortium (CMC http://www.synapse.org/CMC) RNA-seq experiments of
\(>500\) human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) samples.  Analyzing the
extent of allelic expression bias---a hallmark of imprinting---we find that
the number of imprinted human genes is consistent with lower estimates
(\(\approx 0.5 \%\) of all
genes)~\cite{Andergassen2017,Babak2015,Baran2015,DeVeale2012,Perez2015} and
thus contradicts much higher estimates~\cite{Gregg2010a}. Moreover, the handful of
novel putatively imprinted genes we do find are all in close genomic proximity
to known imprinted genes.  Joint analysis of the imprinted genes across
hundreds of individuals allowed us to establish how allelic bias depends on
various factors.  We find that age and genetic ancestry have gene-specific,
differential effect on allelic bias.  In contrast, allelic bias appeared
independent of schizophrenia.  

The observation~\cite{Noor2015,Rees2014} that maternally derived
microduplications at 15q11-q13---harboring the imprinted gene UBE3A---may not
only cause Prader-Willi syndrome, but are also highly penetrant for
schizophrenia has raised the possibility that perturbation of regulation of
imprinted genes in general may play a role in psychotic disorders.  As it is
known that the extent of imprinting of individual genes varies over different
tissues we chose to analyze the DLPFC region, which controls complex cognitive and
executive functions and is known to display functional abnormalities in
schizophrenia.  We obtained pre-publication DLPFC RNA-seq data from the CMC
and analyzed allele-specific expression with the idea of (i) identifying
imprinted genes in the adult human brain and (ii) explaining the
variability in allelic bias across 579 individuals in terms of their
psychiatric diagnosis, age at death, etc.  This was facilitated by the
balanced case-control groups (258 SCZ, 267 Control, 54 bipolar or other
affective/mood disorder, AFF) and the large age variability in the cohort.

For each individual \(i\) and gene \(g\) we quantified allelic bias based on
RNA-seq reads using a statistic called \emph{read count ratio} \(S_{ig}\)
(Fig.~\ref{fig:study-design}, Methods), which ranges from 0.5 to 1 indicating unbiased
biallelic expression (at 0.5), some allelic bias (at intermediate values) or
strictly monoallelic expression (at 1).  We corrected for a number
of factors this approach is known to be sensitive to.  We quality-filtered
RNA-seq reads and helped distinguish allele-specific reads using DNA
genotyping data before calculating \(S\) and then applied post hoc corrections
for mapping bias (Methods).

Of \(15584\) genes with RNA-seq data \(5307\) genes passed our filters designed to remove genes with
scarce RNA-seq data reflecting low expression and/or low coverage of
RNA-seq (Methods, Section~\ref{sec:filtering}).
Fig.~\ref{fig:ranking-genes} presents the conditional empirical distribution
of \(S_{\cdot g}\) across all individuals given each gene \(g\).  The observed wide
\(S_{\cdot g}\) distributions suggest large across-individuals variation of allelic bias for all
genes, even if a substantial component of the \(S_{\cdot g}\) variation originates from technical sources.
Still, as expected, for many genes known to be imprinted in mice or in other human tissues
(referred to as \emph{known imprinted} genes like PEG10, ZNF331) the distribution of \(S_{\cdot g}\) was shifted
to the right signaling strong allelic bias (Fig.~\ref{fig:ranking-genes}, upper
half).

To identify imprinted genes in the human adult DLPFC we defined the score of
each gene \(g\) as the fraction of individuals \(i\) for whom \(S_{ig}>0.9\).
We ranked all 5307 genes according to their score
(Fig.~\ref{fig:ranking-genes} bottom right).  The heat map of the \(S_{\cdot
g}\) distribution for ranked genes (Fig.~\ref{fig:ranking-genes}, lower left)
shows that the top \(50\) genes, which constitute \(\approx 1\%\) of all genes
in our analysis, are qualitatively different from the bottom \(\approx 99\%\)
exhibiting strongly right-shifted distribution of \(S_{\cdot g}\)
characteristic to imprinting.

29 of the top-scoring 50 genes fell into previously described imprinted gene
clusters (Fig.~\ref{fig:clusters}); 21 of these 29 are \emph{known imprinted}
genes while 8 are \emph{nearby candidates} defined as genes near
(\(<1\mathrm{Mb}\) of) \emph{known imprinted} ones but themselves previously
not shown to be imprinted (blue and green \(y\)-axis labels in
Fig.~\ref{fig:top-genes}).   \emph{A priori} the expectation is that
\emph{known imprinted} genes and \emph{nearby candidates} are much more likely
to be imprinted  in the present data set than \emph{distant candidates}
defined as genes that neither belong to nor localize near \emph{known
imprinted} genes (Fig.~\ref{fig:top-genes}, red \(y\)-axis labels).  We
combined this prior expectation with two tests based on our data to
distinguish imprinting from alternative causes of high read count ratio such
as mapping bias and cis-eQTL effects~\cite{Babak2015} (see Methods:
Reference/non-reference allele test and Test for nearly unbiased allelic
expression).  The results of both tests (X's and black bars,
Fig.~\ref{fig:top-genes}) agreed well with the \emph{a priori} expected
status.  This prompted us to call imprinted in the adult human DLPFC those
genes in the top 50 that are either
\emph{known imprinted} or \emph{nearby candidates}.
We included also the \emph{known imprinted} gene UBE3A, which ranked below 50
but whose score was still substantial (Fig.~\ref{fig:known-genes}) yielding 30
imprinted genes (panel headers in Fig.~\ref{fig:S-Dx}-\ref{fig:S-age}).

Getting at the central question of our work Fig.~\ref{fig:S-Dx} shows
that read count ratio is similarly distributed in the Control, SCZ and AFF
group for all 30 imprinted genes suggesting independence between allelic bias and diagnosis of
schizophrenia.

To show this quantitatively we fitted several fixed and mixed effects models~\cite{Hoffman2016}
that model the dependence of read count ratio jointly on all explanatory
variables (Methods,
Section~\ref{sec:regression-overview-informal}-\ref{sec:fitting}).  Such joint
models can capture much of the complex pattern of dependencies in genomic data
including those we observed within and between technical and biological
explanatory variables (Table~\ref{tab:predictors},
Fig.~\ref{fig:predictor-associations}).  For both the fixed and mixed class we
selected the model that fitted the data the best (unlm.Q/wnlm.Q for both fixed
and mixed models,
Fig.~\ref{fig:fitting-fixed-PEG3},~\ref{fig:fitting-fixed-KCNK9},~\ref{fig:fitting-mixed}).
Fixed and mixed models also agreed qualitatively on gene-specific coefficients
reporting effects/dependencies
(Fig~\ref{fig:pred-rnd-coefs},~\ref{fig:pred-fixed-coefs}). We based final
inference on the selected mixed model because that gains power from letting
genes ``borrow strength from each other'' (Fig.~\ref{fig:glm-vs-hierarch}).

Based on the best fitting mixed model (henceforth ``the model'') we could formally
reject the hypotheses that read count ratio depends on diagnosis as either
main effect or interaction (see term \((1\mid\mathrm{Dx})\) and
\((1\,|\,\mathrm{Dx}:\mathrm{Gene})\) in Table~\ref{tab:mod-sel},
respectively).  That this key result is not due to low power is indicated by
the highly significant dependence of read count ratio on gene identity
(see \((1\mid\mathrm{Gene})\) in Table~\ref{tab:mod-sel} and compare panels in
Fig.~\ref{fig:S-Dx}).

Scatter plots suggested that the read count ratio depends negatively on age
for some imprinted genes, depends positively for others, and is independent of
age for the rest of imprinted genes (Fig.~\ref{fig:S-age}
and~\ref{fig:Q-age}).  This apparent dependence might be indirect, i.e.~one
that is mediated by some variable(s) ``inbetween'' age and read count ratio
(Fig.~\ref{fig:predictor-associations},~\ref{fig:glm-vs-hierarch}) but the
model allowed us to isolate the direct component of age dependence: we found
that the gene-specific random age effect is indeed significant even if no
fixed effect---which would be shared by all imprinted genes---was supported
(see \((\mathrm{Age}\,|\,\mathrm{Gene})\) and \(\mathrm{Age}\), respectively,
in Table~\ref{tab:mod-sel}).

Based on the model we also predicted
gene-specific regression coefficients mediating the direct component of age
effect (Fig.~\ref{fig:pred-rnd-coefs} top middle).  The predicted coefficients
agreed well with all but a few panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:S-age} the latter of
which (e.g.~UBE3A) therefore represent purely indirect dependence.

The same type of analysis on the effects of ancestry principal components and
gender gave similar results: while the fixed effect, shared by all genes, of
these variables was negligible, three of the random, gene-specific, effects
received significant support.  These three, ordered by decreasing
statistical significance, are
\((\mathrm{Ancestry.1}\,|\,\mathrm{Gene})\),
\((\mathrm{Ancestry.3}\,|\,\mathrm{Gene})\) and
\((1\,|\,\mathrm{Gender}:\mathrm{Gene})\) (Table~\ref{tab:mod-sel}).  The
corresponding predicted random coefficients are presented in
Fig.~\ref{fig:pred-rnd-coefs}.

In summary age, ancestry, and to a lesser extent gender, are suggested by our
model-based analysis to exert effect on allelic bias in a way that the
direction and magnitude of the effect varies across genes.

The number of imprinted genes in the mammalian brain has been controversial:
some early genome wide studies~\cite{Gregg2010a,Gregg2010} estimated over a
thousand, suggesting that the number of imprinted genes in the brain is an
order of magnitude greater than in other tissues.  Later work cast doubt on
the methodology used and found that the number of imprinted genes in brain is
in line with expectations from studies of other tissues, identifying only a
handful of new candidate imprinted genes in brain~\cite{Baran2015,DeVeale2012,Perez2015}.
Based on 579 postmortem human DLPFC
samples we find evidence supporting only a handful of novel imprinted genes
all of which reside in genomic locations nearby to known imprinted genes.
Thus our results support those more recent studies that found no large excess
of imprinted genes in the brain.

The large size of our sample and the case-control makeup allowed us to explore
the potential for correlation of extent of imprinting in the DLPFC with
schizophrenia.  Although our approach gave strong support for dependence of
imprinting on age and ancestry, no dependence on schizophrenia was detected
either when we assumed that the dependence is the same for all imprinted genes
or that it varies across genes.  Thus our data indicate that imprinting in the
DLFPC does not play a significant role in schizophrenia in contradiction of
the ``imprinted brain'' hypothesis~\cite{Crespi2008}.  Given the complex
genetic architecture of schizophrenia~\cite{Sullivan2012} as well as technical
noise in postmortem brain RNA studies there could still be some correlation of
the extent of imprinting and schizophrenia.

We found that imprinting depends on ancestry in a gene
specific manner but the type of dependence that is shared by all imprinted
genes was not supported.  This is expected because the studied
ancestry variables must incorporate some of the cis expression
QTLs in imprinted genes such that those eQTLS perturb allelic bias in a gene
specific manner.

Our finding that imprinting depends on age in later adulthood is rather
intriguing given the quantitative relationship between epigenetics and
aging~\cite{Horvath2013}.  Age dependence of imprinting through early
postnatal life supported experimentally~\cite{Perez2015} but such dependence
during later adulthood has so far only been predicted~\cite{Ubeda2012} based
on a hypothesis that links ``genomic imprinting and the social
brain''~\cite{Isles2006}.  Previous genomics studies~\cite{Baran2015} were
statistically underpowered to address this question in humans.  Although our
age-related finding supports the ``social brain'' hypothesis, it leaves the
possibility open that the observed age related changes indicate merely the
loss of tight regulation of those genes with aging.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Defining the read count ratio to quantify allelic bias}

We quantified allelic bias based on RNA-seq reads using a statistic called
\emph{read count ratio} \(S\), whose definition we
based on the total read count \(T\) and the \emph{higher read count} \(H\),
i.e.~the count of reads carrying only either the reference or the alternative SNP variant,
whichever is higher.  The
definition is
\begin{equation}
S_{ig} = \frac{H_{ig}}{T_{ig}}= \frac{\sum_s H_s}{\sum_sT_s},
\label{eq:S-definition}
\end{equation}
where \(i\) identifies an individual, \(g\) a gene, and the summation runs
over all SNPs \(s\) for which gene \(g\) is heterozygous in individual \(i\) (Fig.~\ref{fig:study-design}).
Note that if \(B_{ig}\) is the count or reads that map to the \(b_{ig}\) allele
(defined as above) and if we make the same distributional assumption as above, namely that \(B_{ig}\sim
\mathrm{Binom}(p_{ig}, T_{ig})\), then \(\mathrm{Pr}(H_{ig}=B_{ig}|p_{ig})\), the probability of correctly
assigning the reads with the higher count to the allele towards which
expression is biased, tends to 1 as \(p_{ig} \rightarrow 1\).  We took
advantage of this theoretical result in that we subjected only those genes to
statistical inference, whose read count ratio was found to be high and,
therefore, whose \(p_{ig}\) is expected to be high as well.

Fig.~\ref{fig:study-design} illustrates the calculation of \(S_{ig}\) for the
combination of two hypothetical genes, \(g_1,g_2\), and two individuals,
\(i_1,i_2\).  It also shows an example for the less likely event that the lower rather
than the higher read count corresponds to the SNP variant tagging the higher
expressed allele (see SNP \(s_3\) in gene \(g_1\) in individual \(i_2\)).

Before we carried out our read count ratio-based analyses, however, we cleaned
our RNA-seq data by quality-filtering and by improving the accuracy of SNP
calling with the use of DNA SNP array data and imputation. In the following
subsections of Methods we describe the data, these procedures, as well as our
regression models in detail.

\subsection{Brain samples, RNA-seq}

Human RNA samples were collected from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of
the CommonMind consortium from a total of \(579\) individuals after
quality control. Subjects included 267 control individuals, as well as 258
with schizophrenia (SCZ) and 54 with affective spectrum disorder (AFF).
RNA-seq library preparation uses Ribo-Zero (which selects against ribosomal
RNA) to prepare the RNA, followed by Illumina paired end library generation.
RNA-seq was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000.

\subsection{Mapping, SNP calling and filtering}

We mapped 100bp, paired-end RNA-seq reads (\(\approx50\) million reads per sample) using Tophat
to Ensembl gene transcripts of the human genome (hg19; February, 2009) with
default parameters and 6 mismatches allowed per pair (200 bp total). We
required both reads in a pair to be successfully mapped and we removed reads
that mapped to \(>1\) genomic locus. Then, we removed PCR replicates using the
Samtools rmdup utility; around one third of the reads mapped (which is
expected, given the parameters we used and the known high repeat content of
the human genome). We used Cufflinks to determine gene expression of Ensembl
genes, using default parameters. Using the BCFtools utility of Samtools, we
called SNPs (SNVs only, no indels). Then, we invoked a quality filter
requiring a Phred score \(>20\) (corresponding to a probability for an
incorrect SNP call \(<0.01\)).

We annotated known SNPs using dbSNP (dbSNP 138, October 2013). Considering all
579 samples, we find 936,193 SNPs in total, 563,427 (60\%) of which are novel.
Further filtering of this SNP list removed the novel SNPs and removed SNPs
that either did not match the alleles reported in dbSNP or had more than 2
alleles in dbSNP. We also removed SNPs without at least 10 mapped reads in at
least one sample. Read depth was measured using the Samtools Pileup utility.
After these filters were applied, 364,509 SNPs remained in 22,254 genes. These
filters enabled use of data with low coverage.  For the 579
samples there were 203 million reads overlapping one of the
364,509 SNPs defined above.  Of those 158 million (78\%) had genotype data
available from either SNP array or imputation.

\subsection{Genotyping and calibration of imputed SNPs}

DNA samples were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium SNP array. We used
PLINK with default parameters to impute genotypes for SNPs not present on the
Infinium SNP array using 1000 genomes data.  We calibrated the
imputation parameters to find a reasonable balance between the number of genes
assessable for allelic bias and the number false positive
calls since the latter can arise if a SNP is
incorrectly called heterozygous.

We first examined how many SNPs were heterozygous in DNA calls and had a
discordant RNA call (i.e.~homozygous SNP call from RNA-seq) using different imputation
parameters. Known imprinted genes were excluded. We examined RNA-seq reads
overlapping array-called heterozygous SNPs which we assigned a heterozygosity
score \(L_\mathrm{het}\) of 1, separately from RNA seq data
overlapping imputed heterozygous SNPs, where the \(L_\mathrm{het}\) score could
range from 0 to 1.  After testing different thresholds
we selected an \(L_\mathrm{het}\) cutoff of 0.95 (i.e. imputation confidence
level of 95\%), and a minimal coverage of 7 reads per SNP. With these
parameters, the discordance rate (monoallelic RNA genotype in the context of a
heterozygous DNA genotype) was 0.71\% for array-called SNPs and 3.2\% for
imputed SNPs.

The higher rate of discordance for the imputed SNPs
is due to imputation error.  These were taken into
account in two ways.
First, we considered all imputed SNPs for a gene \(g\) and individual \(i\)
jointly.  Second, we excluded
any individual, for which one or more SNPs supported biallelic
expression.

%At this point, the matrix includes 147
%million data points covering 213,208 SNPs, of which 114 million (77\%) have
%imputation data.

\subsection{Quality filtering}

\label{sec:filtering}

Two kind of data filters were applied sequentially: (1) a \emph{read
count-based} and (2) an \emph{individual-based}.  The read count-based filter
removes any such pair $(i,g)$ of individual $i$ and genes $g$ for which the
total read count $T_{ig}<t_\mathrm{rc}$, where the read count threshold
$t_\mathrm{rc}$ was set to 15. The individual-based filter removes any genes
$g$ (across all individuals) if read count data involving $g$ are available
for less than $t_\mathrm{ind}$ number of individuals, set to 25.
These final filtering procedures decreased the number of genes in the data from
\(15584\) to \(n=5307\).

\subsection{Reference/non-reference allele test to correct for mapping bias
and eQTLs}

We designed this test to distinguish imprinting from alternative causes of
high read count ratio (Fig.~\ref{fig:top-genes}): mapping bias or cis-eQTL
effects.  For any given gene this is a possibly compound test since there may
be multiple SNPs that are informative for the read count ratio (see Defining
the read count ratio above).

For a given gene the compound null hypothesis is that the observed high read
count ratio is due only to imprinting.  For each informative SNP this
hypothesis means that the reference and non-reference allele are associated
with equal probability to the \emph{higher read count}~\cite{Babak2015} (see Methods: Defining
the read count ratio to quantify allelic bias).  Thus for each SNP we assumed
that the number of individuals for whom the reference allele is associated to
the \emph{higher read count} is binomially distributed with probability
parameter 0.5.  The we calculated the fraction of informative SNPs for which the
null hypothesis can be rejected at 0.05 significance level and used this
information to decide whether the compound null hypothesis for the gene itself
can be rejected.

\subsection{Test for nearly unbiased allelic expression}

The null hypothesis of this test is that the higher read count
\(H_{ig}=S_{ig}T_{ig}\) for gene \(g\) and individual \(i\) is drawn from a
binomial distribution with a probability parameter \(p_{ig}\approx 0.5\)
suggesting nearly unbiased allelic expression.  More specifically, the test
was defined by the criteria
\begin{equation}
S_{ig} \le 0.6 \text{ and } \mathrm{UCL}_{ig} \le 0.7,
\label{eq:unbiased-test}
\end{equation}
where the 95\% upper confidence limit \(\mathrm{UCL}_{ig}\) for the expected
read count ratio \(p_{ig}\) was calculated assuming that the higher read count
\(H_{ig}\sim \mathrm{Binom}(p_{ig}, T_{ig})\), on the fact that binomial
random variables are asymptotically (as \(T_{ig}\rightarrow \infty\)) normal
with \(\mathrm{var}(H_{ig}) = T_{ig}p_{ig}(1-p_{ig})\), and on the equalities
\(\mathrm{var}(S_{ig}) = \mathrm{var}(H_{ig}/T_{ig}) =
\mathrm{var}(H_{ig})/T_{ig}^2\).  Therefore
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{UCL}_{ig} = S_{ig} + z_{0.975} \sqrt{\frac{S_{ig} (1 - S_{ig})}{T_{ig}}},
\end{equation}
where $z_{p}$ is the $p$ quantile of the standard normal distribution.

\subsection{Data transformations}

We found transformations of the read count ratio data to be useful for fitting
our statistical models
(Section~\ref{sec:regression-overview-informal}-\ref{sec:fitting} below).
We used either (or none) of the following two transformations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
The quasi-log transformation, defined as
\begin{equation}
\tau_Q(S_{ig};T_{ig}) \equiv Q_{ig} = - \log \left( 1 - S_{ig} \frac{T_{ig}}{T_{ig} + c}
\right),
\label{eq:Q}
\end{equation}
where \(S_{ig}\) and \(T_{ig}\) mean read count ratio and total read count for
individual \(i\) and gene \(g\);
\(\log\) means natural logarithm (base \(e\));  \(c\) is a pseudo read
count set to \(1\) in order to avoid zero in the parenthesis since the \(\log\)
function is undefined at \(0\).
\item 
The rank transformation
\begin{equation}
\tau_R(S_{ig};\{S_{jg}\}_j) \equiv R_{ig} = \frac{\# \{j: S_{jg}\le S_{ig}
\}}{\# j} \times 100.
\label{eq:R}
\end{equation}
Note that \(j\) may equal \(i\) in Eq.~\ref{eq:R}.
Thus, this transformation first ranks individual \(i\) among all individuals
\(j\) and then scales the ranks between 0 and 100.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Statistical models: informal overview}
\label{sec:regression-overview-informal}

We modeled the dependence of read count ratio of imprinted genes jointly on
all biological and technical explanatory variables
(Table~\ref{tab:predictors}) using several multiple regression models.  Based
on their structure our models can be classified into two sets of fixed and a
set of mixed regression models (Fig.~\ref{fig:glm-vs-hierarch}).  Furthermore
our models can be also classified based on non-structural properties (link
function, error distribution, weighting, and the data transformation to read
count ratio; see model classes in Table~\ref{tab:model-names}).

Fig.~\ref{fig:glm-vs-hierarch} explains that among the two fixed and the mixed
structural model class the mixed one is both more powerful and robust because
its random effects terms allow gene-specific parts of the model to ``borrow
strength from each other''.  The cost of the enhanced power in mixed models is
the lack of estimates and confidence intervals (as well as p-values) for
gene-specific coefficients (parameters), which the less powerful fixed models
do provide (Fig.~\ref{fig:pred-fixed-coefs}).  Instead of being estimated,
gene-specific coefficients in mixed models therefore can only be
\emph{predicted} without information on confidence surrounding them (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:pred-rnd-coefs} for predicted gene-specific coefficients under a
mixed model).  Nonetheless, the low power and low robustness of fixed models
became apparent from results like those in Fig.~\ref{fig:pred-fixed-coefs} so
we based our final inference (Table~\ref{tab:mod-sel}) on mixed modeling.
Note, however, that we found an overall qualitative agreement between mixed and
fixed models regarding gene-specific coefficients (compare
Fig~\ref{fig:pred-rnd-coefs} and \ref{fig:pred-fixed-coefs}).

To select the best model within the mixed structural class we compared model
fit of the non-structural types (Fig.~\ref{fig:fitting-mixed}) and found
that the unlm.Q and wnlm.Q types fitted the data the best.  Similar results
were obtained for fixed models
(Fig.~\ref{fig:fitting-fixed-PEG3},~\ref{fig:fitting-fixed-KCNK9}).

\subsection{Statistical models: formal overview}
\label{sec:regression-overview-formal}

Our fixed and mixed effects multiple regression models are all generalized
linear models (GLMs).  GLMs in general describe a conditional distribution of
a response variable \(y\) given a linear predictor \(\eta\) such that the
distribution is from the exponential family and that \(\mathrm{E}(y|\eta) =
g^{-1} (\eta)\), where \(g\) is some link function.  In the present context
the response \(y\) is the observed read count ratio that is possibly
transformed to improve the model's fit to the data.  We performed fitting with
the lme4 and stats R packages and tested several combinations of
transformations, link functions, and error distributions
(Table~\ref{tab:model-names}).  For inference we used the best fitting
combination (\(\mathrm{unlm.Q}\), Table~\ref{tab:model-names}) as assessed by
the normality and homoscedasticity of residuals (Fig.~\ref{fig:fitting-mixed},
also Fig.~\ref{fig:fitting-fixed-PEG3},~\ref{fig:fitting-fixed-KCNK9}) as well
as by monitoring convergence.

In mixed GLMs the linear predictor \(\eta = X
\beta + Z b\) and in fixed GLMS \(\eta = X \beta\), where \(X, Z\) are design
matrices containing data on explanatory variables whereas \(\beta \) and \(b\)
are fixed and random vectors of regression coefficients that mediate fixed and
random effects, respectively (see Section~\ref{sec:mixed-mod} and
Fig.~\ref{fig:glm-vs-hierarch} for 
details).

Besides the random effects term \(Zb\) the key difference between
the mixed and fixed models in this study is that the former describes
read count ratio \emph{jointly} for all imprinted genes and the latter
\emph{separately} for each imprinted gene.  An important consequence is that
our mixed models are more powerful because they can utilize 
information shared by all genes.  Therefore we preferred mixed models for final
inference and used fixed models only to guide selection among possible mixed
models (Section~\ref{sec:fitting}).

\subsection{Detailed syntax and semantics of mixed models}
\label{sec:mixed-mod}

Here we describe the detailed syntax and semantics of the normal linear mixed
models combined with a quasi-log transformation \(Q\) of read count ratio as
this combination was found to provide the best fit
(Fig.~\ref{fig:fitting-mixed}).  We have data
on \(579\) individuals and \(30\) imprinted genes and so the response vector is
\(y=(Q_{i_1g_1},...,Q_{i_{579}g_1},Q_{i_1g_2},...,Q_{i_{579}g_2},...,Q_{i_1g_{30}},...,Q_{i_{579}g_{30}})\).
The model in matrix notation is
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:mixed-mod-matrix}
y &=& X \beta + Z b + \varepsilon \\
\varepsilon_i &\overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim}& \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2),\;
i=1,...,mn \\
b &\sim& \mathcal{N}(0, \Omega_b),
\end{eqnarray}
where the size of the covariance matrix \(\Omega_b\) depends on the number of
terms with random effects (the columns of \(Z\)).  Simply put: errors and
random coefficients are all normally distributed.

To clarify the semantics of Eq.~\ref{eq:mixed-mod-matrix} let us consider a
simple toy model with just a few terms in the linear predictor.  But before
expressing it in terms of Eq.~\ref{eq:mixed-mod-matrix} it is easier
to cast it in the compact ``R formalism'' of the stats and lme4 packages of the R
language as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:toy-mod-r}
y \sim \overbrace{1 + \mathrm{Age}}^{\text{fixed effect}} +
\overbrace{\underbrace{(1 + \mathrm{Age} + \mathrm{Ancestry.1} \,|\,
\mathrm{Gene})}_{k=1} +
\underbrace{(1 \,|\, \mathrm{Dx}:\mathrm{Gene})}_{k=2}}^{\text{random
effects}}.
\end{equation}

First note that the random effect term labeled with \(k=1\) can be expanded
into \((1 \,|\, \mathrm{Gene}) + (\mathrm{Age}\,|\, \mathrm{Gene}) +
(\mathrm{Ancestry.1} \,|\, \mathrm{Gene})\).  The `\(1\)'s mean intercept
terms: one as a fixed effect and two as random effects.  The first random
intercept term \((1\,|\,\mathrm{Gene})\) expresses the gene-to-gene
variability in read count ratio (compare panels in Fig.~\ref{fig:S-Dx}
and~\ref{fig:S-age}), in other words the random effect of the
\(\mathrm{Gene}\) variable.  The second random intercept term
\((1\,|\,\mathrm{Dx}:\mathrm{Gene})\) corresponds to the interaction between
psychiatric diagnosis \(\mathrm{Dx}\) and \(\mathrm{Gene}\); it can be
interpreted as the \(\mathrm{Gene}\) specific effect of \(\mathrm{Dx}\)
or---equivalently---as \(\mathrm{Dx}\) specific gene-to-gene
variability.  This term is not likely to be informative as Fig.~\ref{fig:S-Dx}
suggests little \(\mathrm{Gene}\) specific effect of \(\mathrm{Dx}\).

We see that \(\mathrm{Age}\) appears twice: first as a fixed slope effect on \(y\) and
second as a \(\mathrm{Gene}\) specific random slope effect, denoted as
\((\mathrm{Age}\,|\,\mathrm{Gene})\).  The random effect appears to be
supported by Fig.~\ref{fig:S-age} because the dependence of read count ratio
on \(\mathrm{Age}\) varies substantially among genes but the fixed effect is not
supported because the negative dependence seen for several genes is balanced
out by the positive dependence seen for others.  The model includes another
random slope effect: \((\mathrm{Ancestry.1}\,|\,\mathrm{Gene})\) with a
similar interpretation as \((\mathrm{Age}\,|\,\mathrm{Gene})\) but lacks a
fixed effect of \(\mathrm{Ancestry.1}\).

Now we are ready to write the toy model as an expanded special case of
Eq.~\ref{eq:mixed-mod-matrix} as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:toy-mod-math}
y_{i} = \overbrace{\beta_0 + \mathrm{Age}_{i}
\beta_1}^{\text{fixed effects}} +
\overbrace{\underbrace{b_{0}^{(1)} + \mathrm{Age}_i b_1^{(1)} +
\mathrm{Ancestry.1}_i b_{2}^{(1)}}_{\mathrm{Gene}_i} +
\underbrace{b_{0}^{(2)}}_{\mathrm{Dx}_i:\mathrm{Gene}_i}}^{\text{random
effects}} + \varepsilon_i.
\end{equation}

As in the earlier R formalism the terms of the linear predictor
are grouped into fixed and random effects.  Within the latter group we have
two batches of terms indicated by the \(k\) superscripts on the random
regression coefficients \(b_j^{(k)}\).  The first batch
\(\{b_0^{(1)},b_1^{(1)},b_2^{(1)}\}\) corresponds to
\(\{(1\,|\,\mathrm{Gene}), (\mathrm{Age}\,|\,\mathrm{Gene}),
(\mathrm{Ancestry.1}\,|\,\mathrm{Gene})\}\) in Eq.~\ref{eq:toy-mod-r}, the
second batch contains only \(b_0^{(2)}\) corresponding to
\((1\,|\,\mathrm{Dx}:\mathrm{Gene})\).

Within the \(k\)th batch Eq.~\ref{eq:toy-mod-math} contains only a single
intercept coefficient \(b_0^{(k)}\) and, if random slope terms are also
present in the batch, only a single slope coefficient associated with the
variable \(\mathrm{Age}\) or \(\mathrm{Ancestry.1}\).  This is because only a
single level of the factor \(\mathrm{Gene}\) or the composite factor
\(\mathrm{Dx}:\mathrm{Gene}\) needs to be considered for the \(i\)th
observation; these levels are denoted as \(\mathrm{Gene}_i\) and
\(\mathrm{Dx}_i:\mathrm{Gene}_i\), respectively.  Implicitly however,
Eq.~\ref{eq:toy-mod-math} contains the respective coefficients for all levels
of these factors.  For example, there are \(n=30\) intercept coefficients
\(b_j^{(1)}\) each of which corresponds to a given gene.  So to generalize
Eq.~\ref{eq:toy-mod-math} we need \(J_k\) coefficients in the \(k\)th batch,
where \(J_k\) is the product of the number of factor levels and one plus the
number of random slope variables.  This way we can provide the expansion of
the general formula Eq.~\ref{eq:mixed-mod-matrix} using the semantics of the
toy model (Eq.~\ref{eq:toy-mod-r},~\ref{eq:toy-mod-math}) as
\begin{equation}
y_i = \overbrace{\sum_{j=0}^J x_{ij} \beta_j}^{\text{fixed effects}} +
\overbrace{\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{j=0}^{J_k} z_{ij}^{(k)}
b_{j}^{(k)}}^{\text{random effects}} + \varepsilon_i.
\label{eq:mixed-mod-general}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Model fitting and selection}
\label{sec:fitting}

Eq.~\ref{eq:mixed-mod-general} describes a large set of mixed models that
differ in one or more individual terms that constitute their linear predictor.
From this set we aimed to select the best fitting model under the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC).

We used a heuristic search strategy in order to restrict
the vast model space to a relatively small subset of plausible models.  The
search was started at a model whose relatively simple linear predictor was composed of terms
using our prior results based on fixed effects models.  The same results
suggested a sequence in which further terms were progressively added to the
model to test if they improve fit.  Improvement was assessed by \(\Delta
\mathrm{AIC}\) and the \(\chi^2\)-test on the degrees of freedom that
correspond the evaluated term.  If fit improved the term was added otherwise
it was omitted.  Next, further terms were tested.  This iterative procedure
lead to the following model.
\begin{eqnarray*}
Q &\sim&
\mathrm{RIN} + (1 \,|\, \mathrm{RNA\_batch}) + (1 \,|\, \mathrm{Institution}) + (1 \,|\,
\mathrm{Institution}:\mathrm{Individual}) \\
&+& (1 \,|\, \mathrm{Gene}:\mathrm{Institution}) + (1 \,|\, \mathrm{Gender}:\mathrm{Gene}) \\
&+& (\mathrm{Age} + \mathrm{RIN} + \mathrm{Ancestry.1} + \mathrm{Ancestry.3} \,|\, \mathrm{Gene})
\end{eqnarray*}
We refer to this as the ``best
fitting model'' even thought it may represent only a local optimum in model
space.

\caption{ Three model structures: two \emph{fixed} (upper left and right) and
a \emph{mixed} (lower middle) effects multiple regression model.  In all three
model structures the read count ratio \(Y_g\)---for several genes
\(g\)---depends somehow on three explanatory variables \(X_j\) like Age or PMI
(Table~\ref{tab:predictors}).  For each gene \(g\) the probabilistic
dependence is mediated by fixed \(\beta_{1g},\beta_{2g},\beta_{3g}\) or random
\(b_{2g},b_{3g}\) regression coefficients.  \emph{fixed II} is a constrained
version of the \emph{fixed I} model structure such that
\(\beta_{jg_1}=\beta_{jg_2}=...\equiv \beta_j\), which means that the effect
of \(X_j\) on \(Y\) does not vary across genes in \emph{fixed II}.  The
\emph{mixed} model differs from \emph{fixed I}  in the way coefficients across
genes vary for a given explanatory variable \(X_j\).  In the \emph{fixed I}
model structure there is no connection among
\(\beta_{jg_1},\beta_{jg_2},...\), which means that the way \(Y_{g}\), the
read count ratio for gene \(g\) depends on variable \(X_j\) is completely
separate from how the read count ratio for any other gene \(g'\)
(i.e.~\(Y_{g'}\)) depends on \(X_j\).  Consequently, the gene-specific
substructures of \emph{fixed I} contain no information on each other.  This
limitation is overcome with the \emph{mixed} model structure because a set of
coefficients across genes---e.g.~the set \(\{b_{2g}\}_g\))---is modeled as a
random sample from a normal distribution with parameters \(\mu_2\) and some
\(\sigma^2_2>0\).  Thus \(\mu_2\) and \(\sigma^2_2\) constitute information on
the effect that is shared across all genes so that genes ``borrow strength
from each other''.  When \(\sigma^2_j=0\) in the \emph{mixed} model then all parameters \(\{b_{jg}\}_g\) for
\(X_j\) are fixed at \(\mu_j\equiv\beta_j\), which is characteristic to the
\emph{fixed II} model structure.  In the \emph{mixed} model structure this is
seen for \(X_1\), which therefore has the same effect on \(Y_g\) for every
gene \(g\).  In this example all explanatory variables are continuous in both
models.  Any categorical explanatory variable (factor) \(X_j\) with \(K\)
levels would lead to \(K - 1\) fixed or random coefficients
\(\beta_{j_1g},...,\beta_{j_{K-1}g}\) or \(b_{j_1g},...,b_{j_{K-1}g}\) for any
gene \(g\), respectively.  Moreover, if the effect of that categorical \(X_j\)
is random then it is possible to have a continuous \(X_{j'}\) with a random
intercept and slope with respect to \(X_j\).  In fact the \emph{mixed} model structure
(lower middle) is equivalent to another one (not shown), where ``Gene'' is a
random factor \(X_\mathrm{Gene}\) with random slope for the effects of \(X_2\)
and \(X_3\).  }

ratio.  \emph{Right column:} levels of each factor-valued (i.e.~categorical)
variable.  Square brackets \([...]\) surround the baseline level against
which other levels are contrasted.  \emph{Abbreviations:} PMI: post-mortem
interval; Dx: disease status; AFF: affective spectrum disorder; SCZ:
schizophrenia; RIN: RNA integrity number;
Ancestry.\(k\): the \(k\)-th eigenvalue from the decomposition of genotypes
indicating population structure.}

\caption{Fitted regression model families, in which the response variable is the read count ratio with or without some transformation: 
\(S\)---untransformed, \(Q\)---\emph{q}uasi-log-transformed, and
\(R\)---\emph{r}ank-transformed read count ratio.  Diagnostic plots
(Fig.~\ref{fig:fitting-mixed}) and monitoring
convergence suggested that the \(\mathrm{unlm}.Q\) combination allows the
best fit for several linear predictors tested.
