The strength of bias towards the expression of the maternal (red) or paternal (blue) allele of a given gene \(g\) in individual \(i\) is gauged with the count of RNA-seq reads carrying the reference allele (small closed circles) and the count of reads carrying an alternative allele (open squares) at all SNPs for which the individual is heterozygous. The allele with the \emph  {higher read count} tends to match the allele with the higher expression but measurement errors may occasionally revert this tendency as seen for SNP \(s_3\) in gene \(g_1\) in individual \(i_2\). }}{16}}

The \emph  {upper two panels} are distinct representations (survival plot: \(1 - \mathrm  {ECDF}\), and ``survival heatmap'') of the same three distributions corresponding to \(a\): PEG10, \(b\): ZNF331, and \(c\): AFAP1. PEG10 and ZNF331, previously found to be imprinted in mice or in other human tissues, and one for AFAP1, a gene without prior evidence. The bottom two survival heatmaps present the distribution of \(S_{\cdot g}\) for the top \(2\%\) and \(100\%\) of the 5307 analyzed genes. These are ranked according to gene score defined as \(1 - \mathrm  {ECDF}(0.9)\) in the \emph  {bottom far right panels}. The score of PEG10, ZNF331, and AFAP1 is marked by \(a,b,c\), respectively, in green circles. As expected, PEG10 and ZNF331 both score high and rank within the top 30 of all genes suggesting they are also imprinted in the present context, the adult human DLFPC.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {S5}{\ignorespaces  Three model structures: two \emph  {fixed} (upper left and right) and a \emph  {mixed} (lower middle) effects multiple regression model. In all three model structures the read count ratio \(Y_g\)---for several genes \(g\)---depends somehow on three explanatory variables \(X_j\) like Age or PMI (Table\nobreakspace  {}S1\hbox {}). For each gene \(g\) the probabilistic dependence is mediated by fixed \(\beta _{1g},\beta _{2g},\beta _{3g}\) or random \(b_{2g},b_{3g}\) regression coefficients. \emph  {fixed II} is a constrained version of the \emph  {fixed I} model structure such that \(\beta _{jg_1}=\beta _{jg_2}=...\equiv \beta _j\), which means that the effect of \(X_j\) on \(Y\) does not vary across genes in \emph  {fixed II}. The \emph  {mixed} model differs from \emph  {fixed I} in the way coefficients across genes vary for a given explanatory variable \(X_j\). In the \emph  {fixed I} model structure there is no connection among \(\beta _{jg_1},\beta _{jg_2},...\), which means that the way \(Y_{g}\), the read count ratio for gene \(g\) depends on variable \(X_j\) is completely separate from how the read count ratio for any other gene \(g'\) (i.e.\nobreakspace  {}\(Y_{g'}\)) depends on \(X_j\). Consequently, the gene-specific substructures of \emph  {fixed I} contain no information on each other. This limitation is overcome with the \emph  {mixed} model structure because a set of coefficients across genes---e.g.\nobreakspace  {}the set \(\{b_{2g}\}_g\))---is modeled as a random sample from a normal distribution with parameters \(\mu _2\) and some \(\sigma ^2_2>0\). Thus \(\mu _2\) and \(\sigma ^2_2\) constitute information on the effect that is shared across all genes so that genes ``borrow strength from each other''. When \(\sigma ^2_j=0\) in the \emph  {mixed} model then all parameters \(\{b_{jg}\}_g\) for \(X_j\) are fixed at \(\mu _j\equiv \beta _j\), which is characteristic to the \emph  {fixed II} model structure. In the \emph  {mixed} model structure this is seen for \(X_1\), which therefore has the same effect on \(Y_g\) for every gene \(g\). In this example all explanatory variables are continuous in both models. Any categorical explanatory variable (factor) \(X_j\) with \(K\) levels would lead to \(K - 1\) fixed or random coefficients \(\beta _{j_1g},...,\beta _{j_{K-1}g}\) or \(b_{j_1g},...,b_{j_{K-1}g}\) for any gene \(g\), respectively. Moreover, if the effect of that categorical \(X_j\) is random then it is possible to have a continuous \(X_{j'}\) with a random intercept and slope with respect to \(X_j\). In fact the \emph  {mixed} model structure (lower middle) is equivalent to another one (not shown), where ``Gene'' is a random factor \(X_\mathrm  {Gene}\) with random slope for the effects of \(X_2\) and \(X_3\). }}{26}}
