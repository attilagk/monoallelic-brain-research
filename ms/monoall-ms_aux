\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {S1}{\ignorespaces  General dependency structures in two fixed effects regression models (\emph  {left}, \emph  {middle}) and a mixed effects model (\emph  {right}). In all three cases the regression coefficients \(\beta _{1g},...,\beta _{3g}\) or \(\beta _{1g},b_{2g},b_{3g}\) mediate, for a given gene \(g\), probabilistic dependencies (arrows) between the response variable \(Y_g\) (read count ratio for \(g\)) and the corresponding explanatory variables \(X_1,...,X_3\). For simplicity but without loss of generality only 3 explanatory variables are depicted. The model frameworks differ in how the coefficients relate to each other for a given explanatory variable (or a given \(j\)). \emph  {Left:} there is no connection among \(\beta _{jg_1},\beta _{jg_2},...\) which means that the way \(Y_{g}\), the read count ratio for gene \(g\) depends on variable \(X_j\) is completely separate from how the read count ratio for any other gene \(g'\) (i.e.\nobreakspace  {}\(Y_{g'}\)) depends on it. Consequently no information may be shared among gene-specific models. \emph  {Middle:} In this case \(\beta _{jg_1}=\beta _{jg_2}=...\equiv \beta _j\) so that all genes are identical with respect to how their read count ratio depends the explanatory variables. Thus genes share all information in the data in the sense that the model forces them to be identical. \emph  {Right:} Hierarchical mixed effects model where certain dependencies (\(\beta _1\)) are shared among genes while others (\(\{b_{2g}\}_g, \{b_{3g}\}_g\)) vary across genes. The variation is controlled by the variance parameters \(\sigma ^2_j\). In this example there is a single set \(\{b_{2g}\}_g\) of random coefficients for \(X_2\)---and a similar set for \(X_3\)---, which are random intercepts. In general, however, one or more set of random slope coefficients may also be present. Given the estimates \(\mathaccentV {hat}05E{\sigma }^2_j\) and the data the gene-specific random coefficients \(b_{jg}\) can be predicted. Among the three only this model framework allows information sharing among genes in a flexible way. }}{19}}
