In all of threse model frameworks the regression coefficients \(\beta _{1g},...,\beta _{3g}\) mediate, for a given gene \(g\), probabilistic dependencies (arrows) between the response variable \(Y_g\) (read count ratio for \(g\)) and the corresponding predictors \(X_1,...,X_3\). For simplicity but without loss of generality only 3 predictors are depicted. The model frameworks differ in how \(\beta _{jg_1},\beta _{jg_2},...\) relate to each other for a given predictor (or a given \(j\)). \emph  {Left:} there is no connection among \(\beta _{jg_1},\beta _{jg_2},...\) which means that the way \(Y_{g}\), the read count ratio for gene \(g\) depends on predictor \(X_j\) is completely separate from how the read count ratio for any other gene \(g'\) (i.e.\nobreakspace  {}\(Y_{g'}\)) depends on it. Consequently no information may be shared among gene-specific models. \emph  {Middle:} In this case \(\beta _{jg_1}=\beta _{jg_2}=...\equiv \beta _j\) so that all genes are identical with respect to how their read count ratio depends the predictors. Thus genes share all information in the data in the sense that the model forces them to be identical. \emph  {Right:} Hierarchical Bayesian model where genes show both variation as well as invariance with regards to depenencies. The variation is described by the dependence of \(\beta _j\) on the hyperparameter \(\gamma _j\), whereas the invariance by the dependence of \(\gamma _j\) on \emph  {its} hyperparameter \(\xi _j\).
