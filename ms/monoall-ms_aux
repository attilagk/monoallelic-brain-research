\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Quantifying allelic bias of expression in human individuals using the RNA-seq read count ratio statistic \(S_{ig}\). The strength of bias towards the expression of the maternal (red) or paternal (blue) allele of a given gene \(g\) in individual \(i\) is gauged with the count of RNA-seq reads carrying the reference allele (small closed circles) and the count of reads carrying an alternative allele (open squares) at all SNPs for which the individual is heterozygous. The allele with the \emph  {higher read count} tends to match the allele with the higher expression but measurement errors may occasionally revert this tendency as seen for SNP \(s_3\) in gene \(g_1\) in individual \(i_2\). }}{15}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces Across-individuals distribution of read count ratio \(S\) for each gene indicates substantial variation of allelic bias and that \(<1\%\) of all genes are imprinted. The vertically arranged four main panels present the empirical distribution of \(S_{\cdot g}\) across all individuals given each gene \(g\). The \emph  {upper two panels} are distinct representations (survival plot: \(1 - \mathrm  {ECDF}\), and ``survival heatmap'') of the same three distributions corresponding to \(a\): PEG10, \(b\): ZNF331, and \(c\): AFAP1. PEG10 and ZNF331, previously found to be imprinted in mice or in other human tissues, and one for AFAP1, a gene without prior evidence. The bottom two survival heatmaps present the distribution of \(S_{\cdot g}\) for the top \(2\%\) and \(100\%\) of the 5307 analyzed genes. These are ranked according to gene score defined as \(1 - \mathrm  {ECDF}(0.9)\) in the \emph  {bottom far right panels}. The score of PEG10, ZNF331, and AFAP1 is marked by \(a,b,c\), respectively, in green circles. As expected, PEG10 and ZNF331 both score high and rank within the top 30 of all genes suggesting they are also imprinted in the present context, the adult human DLFPC. The bottom panels also indicate that \(<1\%\) of all genes might be imprinted. }}{16}}

The tan colored bars indicate the fraction of individuals with nearly unbiased expression (Eq.\nobreakspace  {}2\hbox {}). Gene names (\(y\) axis) are colored according to prior imprinting status: known imprinted (blue), nearby candidate (green), and distant candidate (red). ``X'' characters next to gene names indicate mapping bias and/or cis-eQTL effects based on the reference/non-reference allele test (Methods) while ``0'' indicates that total allele count was insufficient for this test. }}{17}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {S4}{\ignorespaces  General dependency structures in two fixed effects regression models (\emph  {left}, \emph  {middle}) and a mixed effects model (\emph  {right}). In all three cases the regression coefficients \(\beta _{1g},...,\beta _{3g}\) or \(\beta _{1g},b_{2g},b_{3g}\) mediate, for a given gene \(g\), probabilistic dependencies (arrows) between the response variable \(Y_g\) (read count ratio for \(g\)) and the corresponding explanatory variables \(X_1,...,X_3\). For simplicity but without loss of generality only 3 explanatory variables are depicted. The model frameworks differ in how the coefficients relate to each other for a given explanatory variable (or a given \(j\)). \emph  {Left:} there is no connection among \(\beta _{jg_1},\beta _{jg_2},...\) which means that the way \(Y_{g}\), the read count ratio for gene \(g\) depends on variable \(X_j\) is completely separate from how the read count ratio for any other gene \(g'\) (i.e.\nobreakspace  {}\(Y_{g'}\)) depends on it. Consequently no information may be shared among gene-specific models. \emph  {Middle:} In this case \(\beta _{jg_1}=\beta _{jg_2}=...\equiv \beta _j\) so that all genes are identical with respect to how their read count ratio depends the explanatory variables. Thus genes share all information in the data in the sense that the model forces them to be identical. \emph  {Right:} Hierarchical mixed effects model where certain dependencies (\(\beta _1\)) are shared among genes while others (\(\{b_{2g}\}_g, \{b_{3g}\}_g\)) vary across genes. The variation is controlled by the variance parameters \(\sigma ^2_j\). In this example there is a single set \(\{b_{2g}\}_g\) of random coefficients for \(X_2\)---and a similar set for \(X_3\)---, which are random intercepts. In general, however, one or more set of random slope coefficients may also be present. Given the estimates \(\mathaccentV {hat}05E{\sigma }^2_j\) and the data the gene-specific random coefficients \(b_{jg}\) can be predicted. Among the three only this model framework allows information sharing among genes in a flexible way. }}{24}}
