\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5}{\ignorespaces  Three model structures: two \emph  {fixed} (upper left and right) and a \emph  {mixed} (lower middle) effects multiple regression model. In all three model structures the read count ratio \(Y_g\)---for several genes \(g\)---depends somehow on three explanatory variables \(X_j\) like Age or PMI (Table\nobreakspace  {}1\hbox {}). For each gene \(g\) the probabilistic dependence is mediated by fixed \(\beta _{1g},\beta _{2g},\beta _{3g}\) or random \(b_{2g},b_{3g}\) regression coefficients. \emph  {fixed II} is a constrained version of the \emph  {fixed I} model structure such that \(\beta _{jg_1}=\beta _{jg_2}=...\equiv \beta _j\), which means that the effect of \(X_j\) on \(Y\) does not vary across genes in \emph  {fixed II}. The \emph  {mixed} model differs from \emph  {fixed I} in the way coefficients across genes vary for a given explanatory variable \(X_j\). In the \emph  {fixed I} model structure there is no connection among \(\beta _{jg_1},\beta _{jg_2},...\), which means that the way \(Y_{g}\), the read count ratio for gene \(g\) depends on variable \(X_j\) is completely separate from how the read count ratio for any other gene \(g'\) (i.e.\nobreakspace  {}\(Y_{g'}\)) depends on \(X_j\). Consequently, the gene-specific substructures of \emph  {fixed I} contain no information on each other. This limitation is overcome with the \emph  {mixed} model structure because a set of coefficients across genes---e.g.\nobreakspace  {}the set \(\{b_{2g}\}_g\))---is modeled as a random sample from a normal distribution with parameters \(\mu _2\) and some \(\sigma ^2_2>0\). Thus \(\mu _2\) and \(\sigma ^2_2\) constitute information on the effect that is shared across all genes so that genes ``borrow strength from each other''. When \(\sigma ^2_j=0\) in the \emph  {mixed} model then all parameters \(\{b_{jg}\}_g\) for \(X_j\) are fixed at \(\mu _j\equiv \beta _j\), which is characteristic to the \emph  {fixed II} model structure. In the \emph  {mixed} model structure this is seen for \(X_1\), which therefore has the same effect on \(Y_g\) for every gene \(g\). In this example all explanatory variables are continuous in both models. Any categorical explanatory variable (factor) \(X_j\) with \(K\) levels would lead to \(K - 1\) fixed or random coefficients \(\beta _{j_1g},...,\beta _{j_{K-1}g}\) or \(b_{j_1g},...,b_{j_{K-1}g}\) for any gene \(g\), respectively. Moreover, if the effect of that categorical \(X_j\) is random then it is possible to have a continuous \(X_{j'}\) with a random intercept and slope with respect to \(X_j\). In fact the \emph  {mixed} model structure (lower middle) is equivalent to another one (not shown), where ``Gene'' is a random factor \(X_\mathrm  {Gene}\) with random slope for the effects of \(X_2\) and \(X_3\). }}{6}}

Black curve: LOESS data smoother. \emph  {Lower right (Influence of outliers):} Influence of each individual on the fit quantified by Cook's distance (\(y\)-axis).

A few findings are notable. First, these results are less significant in general than those obtained from the full data set (Table\nobreakspace  {}1), which follows from the reduction both in the number of data points and in the number of genes. Second, the term \((\mathrm  {Age}\tmspace  +\thinmuskip {.1667em}|\tmspace  +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\mathrm  {Gene})\) is significant for odd ranked genes but not for even ranked genes. This agrees with the qualitative pattern seen in Fig.\nobreakspace  {}4\hbox {}, where the genes in the odd columns show a pronounced variability with respect to age dependence but genes in even columns do not. The differences between the two subsets are also explained in part by the fact that there happen to be more missing data for even ranked genes. }}{15}}
