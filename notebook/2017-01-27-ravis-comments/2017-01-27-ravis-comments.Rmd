## General

From Ravi's email to Andy (January 27, 2017 at 12:35:30 AM EST)

> Broadly, I think expanding captions of figures would help, I sometimes had trouble understanding the message from a graph/plot. also, the fits  to various parameters could probably be moved to supplementary (at least in cases where the parameters, like age, seemed to not have a predictive value). and maybe a conclusion section would be useful (I think some journals also require it).

> I also had questions on various numbers etc. and some suggestions which are embedded in the pdf.

Turning to his embedded comments in the [edited PDF][pdf]... p1:

> one broad comment on figure captions. I feel that each figure should have a take-home message, and reading the captions, I did not always get an idea of what the message/point of the figure was.

## Specific

More embedded comments:

### p6

"Then, we removed PCR replicates using the Samtools rmdup utility; around one
third of the reads mapped (which is expected, given the parameters we used and
the known high repeat content of the human genome)."

> 2/3 did not map, that seems to be a bit high. How many reads were ribosomal RNA ? and excluding that what percentage did not map. Most mRNA should be repeat-free 

### p6

"Using the BCFtools utility of Samtools, we called SNPs (SNVs only, no
indels). Then, we invoked a quality filter requiring a Phred score > 20
(corresponding to a probability for an incorrect SNP call < 0.01)."

> how many got filtered out with this criterion ? most bases should have phred > 30 ?

### p7

"Read depth was measured using the Samtools Pileup utility. After these
filters were applied, 364,509 SNPs remained in 22,254 genes."

> probably less that 10K genes had sufficient expression to allow SNP calls ?

### p7

"We calibrated the imputation parameters to find a reasonable balance
between the number of genes assessable for allelic bias and the number false positive calls since
the latter can arise if a SNP is incorrectly called heterozygous."

> what are the results if imputed SNPS are not used ?

### p13, Fig 3 legend

> maybe genes that would not be on this list without the imputed SNPs should be highlighted in a different color ?

### p15, Fig 4 legend

> is there a message to this set of graphs ? I was not sure what message I should take hom from this.

### p22: Discussion

> It seems like the fits did not really find any variable that was predictive. In which case why show all the figures (maybe they can go into supplementary data)

### p24

"In conclusion,..."

> would it help to have a Conclusion section  ? I think that would help wrap up the message for the reader
