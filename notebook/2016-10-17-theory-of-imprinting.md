## Introduction

## Kinship theory

The model of [Ubeda2012] assumes a viscous population, "where dispersal is rare enough for populations to be closely related" ([kin selection][kin_selection] on Wikipedia).  However, kin recognition might be more applicable in humans.

## The imprinted brain theory

This theory [Badcock2011], [Crespi2008a], [Crespi2008] asserts that maternal genes promote hypermentalism corresponding to psychotic spectrum disorders (e.g. SCZ) while paternal ones promote hypomentalism corresponding to autistic spectrum disorders.  This is supported by *genomic sister-disorders*, where one disorder is associated with imbalance towards maternal and the sister disorder with that towards paternal genes at an imprinted gene cluster; an example is the Prader-Willi syndrome (maternal dominance) paired with the Angelman syndrome (paternal dominance).  Demographic studies of post-famine periods suggest that the starvation of the mother mimics the maternally expressed imprinted genes' resource-sparing, growth-inhibiting effect and, suggestively, this coincides with increased risk of SCZ of the child.  Below is a figure taken from [Crespi2008a].
