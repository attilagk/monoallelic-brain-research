I wrote a article (accessible [here][pdf]) with the same title as this post.
The article evaluates the current state of the "monoallelic expression project" (MAE) by

* clarifying its hypotheses, analytical approaches, results and conclusions
* examining those in light of some plausible statistical models of genome- and population-wise allelic exclusion
* suggesting modified conclusions or reanalysis.
