## General questions

### More data and/or better model?

Explaining variation of allelic bias

* Given the performed model checking and the estimated significance (CI, p-values) how solid are the results?
    * if the employed model is correct the interpretation of CI and p-values is clear, isn't it?
    * in the other case: what is specifically incorrect about the model and to what extent does it affect the results?
* What are the most efficient ways to make results more solid
    * more data: requires reimplementation of low-level pipeline and has little use if the model is incorrect
    * better model: requires adapting an existing one (e.g. limma/voom) or designing a new one

### Genome-wide assessment: what's new?

* what are the most important findings considering two points:
1. several studies, and even Dulac's own group, have shown that Dulac et al previous estimate of >1000 imprinted genes is hugely inflated
1. the Lappalainen group ([Baran et al][Baran et al]) already assessed allelic bias in the human brain albeit using a smaller data set of not specified brain regions


## Specific collaborators, coauthors

### CMC WorkGroup

I must become a member in order to access data and results.  Who can grant me admission?

### Gabriel Hoffman

Thoughtful comments.  The suggested analyses and modifications sound useful but would require reimplementation of low-level pipeline.  The suggested improvements to the presentation would be also useful and they are easy to do.

* Are the regression results solid?  If not: more data and/or better model?  See above.
* terminology
    * "allelic bias": OK or replace with something else (e.g. allelic imbalance, allele-specific expression)?
    * suggestions for replacing wnlm.Q, logi.S, etc
