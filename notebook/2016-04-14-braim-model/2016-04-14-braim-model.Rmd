title: Bayesian regression allelic imbalance model (BRAIM)
tags: [modeling, regression, article]
---

The Bayesian regression allelic imbalance model (BRAIM) was published by Dulac and coworkers (Perez et al, [eLife 2015;4:e07860][Perez et al]) and was applied to RNA-seq data from the cerebellum of crossed F1 hybrid mice in same study to investigate:

* which genes are monoallelically expressed (imprinted), and to what degree
* the effect of cross, sex and age

Perez et al presents many interesting findings but here I focus only on BRAIM and compare it to the models I present in [this earlier post][binom models], which I will collectively refer to as AGK models using the initials of my name.  For my analysis read on [2016-04-14-braim-model.pdf][pdf].
