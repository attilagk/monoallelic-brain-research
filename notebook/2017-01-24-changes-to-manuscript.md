Following a discussion with Andy and Chaggai, the following changes have been made to the manuscript:

1. All figures and tables have been moved below the References section to facilitate submission to journals
1. Figure S1 (Clustering of top-scoring genes) has now a *fourth* gene category called *below top 50*.  In conjunction with this, the term *candidate* has been redefined to mean genes in the top 50 that were not known previously to be imprinted.
1. The original Figure 4 (Variation of read count ratio) has been duplicated to Fig 4 and a new supplementary Fig.  The new Fig 4 has been changed so that gender information is *not* shown, so that Fig 4 has become grayscale.  The main text and figure legends have been updated accordingly.
1. Figure 7: I clarified the scaling in the figure legend by inserting the sentence: "*Note that the coefficients for different predictors
are on different scale in general therefore it is not meaningful to compare them across
graphs.*"

Suggested changes that have not been undertaken:

* Supplementary Figure 13 (Significance of association...), formerly Fig. S12, remained unchanged despite the suggestion to remove those symbols that represent genes for which the fit was excluded (or failed) under the logi.S model.  Justification: the shape of the symbols already informs on whether logi.S was also fitted for a given gene.  Moreover, removal of the said symbols would require substantial programming.  I doubt this minor point would be worth the effort.
