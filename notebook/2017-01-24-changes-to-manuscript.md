Following a discussion with Andy and Chaggai, the following changes have been made to the manuscript:

* Figure S1 (Clustering of top-scoring genes) has now a *fourth* gene category called *below top 50*.  In conjunction with this, the term *candidate* has been redefined to mean genes in the top 50 that were not known previously to be imprinted.
* The original Figure 4 (Variation of read count ratio) has been duplicated to Fig 4 and a new supplementary Fig.  The new Fig 4 has been changed so that gender information is *not* shown, so that Fig 4 has become grayscale.  The main text and figure legends have been updated accordingly.
