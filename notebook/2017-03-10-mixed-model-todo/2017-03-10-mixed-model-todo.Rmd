Summary of planned task for the completion of this research project.

* finalize model selection; use *unlm.Q* family and fine-tune terms of linear predictor
    * include imprinted gene cluster as predictor (embed genes in it)
* predict *Age*, *Ancestry.1*, *Gender* effect for each gene
* variance partitioning
    * try adapting `variancePartition` to complete model
    * consult with Gabriel
* conditional inference: institution
* checking p-value for the random effect of *Age*
    1. random permutations (suggested by Andy); see `lme4` performance tips in `lme4::lmerperf`
    1. profile likelihood
