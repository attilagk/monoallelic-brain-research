reviewer #1,We write “pre-publication DLPFC RNA-seq data” but Fromer et al (ref 6) already published the data,,remove the word “pre-publication”
reviewer #1,"Removal of PCR replicates in RNA-seq data? This is necessary for SNP calling, but the replicates should be retained for expression analysis.",,"The reviewer’s concern is valid.  RNA seq reads may be multiplied both by PCR from a single transcript (an artifact) or by multiplication of transcripts (the biological signal).  Therefore both the removal of all duplicate reads and the non-removal of any reads leads to biased estimation of expression levels.  In our previous published work (Fromer et al) we chose to remove all duplicate reads and for consistency we made the same choice in the present work.  One advantage of this choice is that the bias reduces the estimated variation of expression levels, therefore it is a statistically more conservative approach than the other extreme of not removing any reads.  In future work we are looking forward to redesigning our analysis and include more sophisticated PCR error correction (based on ref https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1471-9)"
reviewer #1,Is there a better way to display these data or provide other values?,,"Yes, there is an alternative, in some sense better way to display the data in Fig 5.  We have added a supporting figure (Fig S???) similar to Fig 5 with the difference that we plot the Q statistic, the quasi log transformed read count ratio.  Q appeared more informative than the untransformed read count ratio S on the dependence on age and other explanatory variables.  Moreover, Q was used for fitting the regression models instead of S because the fit was better with Q (see figs S6, S7, S8)."
reviewer #1,"In Figure S3, labels for Institution, Gender, diagnosis, or ancestry are not included",,We updated this figure with the requested labels.
reviewer #2,the title is misleading and “in Schizophrenia” should be removed,,Do we really want to change the title?  It’s not clear what the reviewer suggests for the new title.
reviewer #2,if the authors applied their method to other tissues,,"In this study we chose to focus all our efforts to the DLPFC area because of manyfold evidence that this tissue is relevant to SCZ.  This was confirmed by our preceding work, Fromer et al (ref #6).  Had we found even week evidence for involvement of imprinted genes’ allelic bias in SCZ in the DLPFC, we would have considered expanding the scope of our present study.  But given our present findings, it doesn’t appear as a promising direction to endeavor."
,How robust the results are the arbitrarily chosen “S_{ig} > 0.9” threshold? If 0.7 were chosen how would the top 50 genes change?,,The 0.9 threshold is not completely arbitrary because imprinted genes have been found to have high allelic bias; higher than that caused by eQTLs of not imprinted genes (ref ???).
,Couldn’t genes simply be ranked by the sum of the S_{ig} scores across individuals?,,"Yes, the gene score could have been done with the sum of S_{ig} scores---or equivalently their average---across individuals for any given gene. Our approach is based on the 90 percentile instead of the average, which has two advantages.  First, percentiles are less affected by outliers that may potentially emerge due to technical artifacts.  Second, as we explain above, the appropriate percentile can be selected (90% in this case) to reflect the biologically meaningful part of the distribution, i.e. the fraction of individuals for whom the gene in question is imprinted."
