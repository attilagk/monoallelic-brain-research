reviewer #1,We write “pre-publication DLPFC RNA-seq data” but Fromer et al (ref 6) already published the data,,remove the word “pre-publication”
reviewer #1,"Removal of PCR replicates in RNA-seq data? This is necessary for SNP calling, but the replicates should be retained for expression analysis.",,"The reviewer’s concern is valid.  RNA seq reads may be multiplied both by PCR from a single transcript (an artifact) or by multiplication of transcripts (the biological signal).  Therefore both the removal of all duplicate reads and the non-removal of any reads leads to biased estimation of expression levels.  In our previous published work (Fromer et al) we chose to remove all duplicate reads and for consistency we made the same choice in the present work.  One advantage of this choice is that the bias reduces the estimated variation of expression levels, therefore it is a statistically more conservative approach than the other extreme of not removing any reads.  In future work we are looking forward to redesigning our analysis and include more sophisticated PCR error correction (based on ref https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1471-9)"
reviewer #1,Is there a better way to display these data or provide other values?,,"Yes, there is an alternative, in some sense better way to display the data in Fig 5.  We have added a supporting figure (Fig S11) similar to Fig 5 with the difference that we plot the Q statistic, the quasi log transformed read count ratio.  Q appeared more informative than the untransformed read count ratio S on the dependence on age and other explanatory variables.  Moreover, Q was used for fitting the regression models instead of S because the fit was better with Q (see figs S6, S7, S8)."
reviewer #1,"In Figure S3, labels for Institution, Gender, diagnosis, or ancestry are not included",,We updated this figure with the requested labels.
reviewer #2,the title is misleading and “in Schizophrenia” should be removed,,Do we really want to change the title?  It’s not clear what the reviewer suggests for the new title.
reviewer #2,if the authors applied their method to other tissues,,"In this study we chose to focus all our efforts to the DLPFC area because of manyfold evidence that this tissue is relevant to SCZ.  This was confirmed by our preceding work, Fromer et al (ref #6).  Had we found even week evidence for involvement of imprinted genes’ allelic bias in SCZ in the DLPFC, we would have considered expanding the scope of our present study.  But given our present findings, it doesn’t appear as a promising direction to endeavor."
reviewer #2,How robust the results are the arbitrarily chosen “S_{ig} > 0.9” threshold? If 0.7 were chosen how would the top 50 genes change?,,"The 0.9 threshold is not completely arbitrary because imprinted genes are known to have high allelic bias.  Nonetheless, we took the reviewer’s advice and investigated how the gene score changes if we use threshold 0.7 instead of 0.9.  A new supplementary figure Fig S12 shows that the ranking wtaith threshold 0.7 is roughly consistent with tat threshold 0.9.hat "
reviewer #2,Couldn’t genes simply be ranked by the sum of the S_{ig} scores across individuals?,,"Yes, the gene score could have been done with the sum of S_{ig} scores---or equivalently their average---across individuals for any given gene. Our approach is based on the 90 percentile instead of the average, which has two advantages.  First, percentiles are less affected by outliers that may potentially emerge due to technical artifacts.  Second, as we explain above, the appropriate percentile can be selected (90% in this case) to reflect the biologically meaningful part of the distribution, i.e. the fraction of individuals for whom the gene in question is imprinted."
reviewer #2,"question about the “top 50” genes, why 50, how would the top 20, top 100 behave in terms of imprinting enrichment?",,Figure 3 demonstrates that below about rank 25 (lower half) most of the genes are false positives as they tend to have mapping bias and a high fraction of nearly unbiased data points (tan bars).  Thus taking the top 50 genes with respect to the gene score is sufficient and there is no need to go deeper (such as top 100).
reviewer #2,"make the point by drawing a ROC curve (truth=known imprinted genes, S_{ig}>.9 fraction as predictor)",,"We make the point with the new supporting figure (Fig S12), which shows the distribution of gene score for known imprinted genes, nearby candidates, and all other genes."
reviewer #2,How robust are the model fit conclusions (e.g. about age random effect) to changes in gene selection (i.e. taking more or less imprinted genes with skewed allelic ratio?),,TODO: randomly select 15 genes and fit the same mixed model
reviewer #2,why did the authors not test disease status as a fixed effect for one gene at a time,,"We did in fact test the effect of disease status (Dx) as a fixed effect on each of the 30 imprinted gene.  But we didn’t emphasize these because the fixed effects model is less robust and powerful than the mixed model.  In any case, the results based on fixed effects modeling are shown in Fig S9."
reviewer #2,"why did the authors not test disease status […] not only considering the 30 genes, but all ~5k genes",,"We did not investigate thousands of non-imprinted genes for two reasons.  First, the scope of our work is imprinted genes.  Second, the results for imprinted genes show that disease status has at most a mild effect on read count ratio, while effects of other variables (including technical ones) are substantial.  Hence, multivariate modeling is required to isolate the effect of disease status.  But fitting multivariate regression models---especially the powerful mixed ones we used for the 30 imprinted genes---is computationally very costly.  It is not feasible to do on hundreds, let alone thousands of genes."
reviewer #2,"According to figure 4, they tested the 30 genes one at a time (although I don’t find the corresponding model described in the methods section).",,"Figure 4 presents only a qualitative analysis of the potential effect of disease status on read count ratio.  As mentioned earler, quantitiative analysis included both joint (mixed) modeling as well as less powerful and robust one-at-a-time (fixed effects) modeling of genes.  Both kind of modeling is described in Methods sections 2.9 – 2.11."
reviewer #2,Why not more than 30?,,TODO: K-L divergence?
reviewer #2,The model fit descriptions on page 4 (bottom half) are far too technical for the readership of Nat Comms. Please better describe the meaning of the significant random effect components (e.g. indirect component of the age effect).,,TODO: extend that section with intuitive explanation
reviewer #2,"“Of 15584 genes with RNA-seq data 5307 genes passed our filters designed to remove genes with scarce RNA-seq data reflecting low expression and/or low coverage of RNA-seq (Methods, Section 2.5).” – It seems a bit too stringent as a filter: many potential genes with allelic bias may have been thrown out at this stage. Is the method so sensitive that such harsh filters are necessary, or is it simply being overly cautious? If it is the former, it would need to be mentioned as a weakness that only a third of the genes can be tested.",,"We share the concern of the reviewer.  The problem is that we cannot make use of all reads that map to the exome but only those that map to heterozygous SNPs in the exome.  This dramatically reduces the amount of data informative on allelic bias and forces us to use stringent filtering, throwing out about 2/3 of all genes."
reviewer #2,"I do not see how low power can be excluded here: “That this key result is not due to low power is indicated by the highly significant dependence of read count ratio on gene identity” Just because genes have different read count ratios, it proves that the study was well-powered to detect differences between normal and SCZ brains?",,In the mixed model the Gene variable (which identifies the gene that a particular data point corresponds to) is similar to the Dx variable (reporting on disease status) in that they are both categorical and are modeled as random effects.  If Dx had an effect size that’s comparable to the effect of Gene than that effect would be detected by our model based inference since the effect of Gene is highly significant (Table I)
reviewer #2,Where is the “nearly unbiased allelic expression” test used in the manuscript?,,"We used that test to derive the black bars in Fig 3.  We mention this in the main text (page 4, paragraph 1)."
